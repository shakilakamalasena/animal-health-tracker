# Animal Health Tracker

The Animal Health Tracker proposes an innovative solution designed to address the 
complexities and challenges inherent in managing animal health records within conservation 
centers. The comprehensive application offers a centralized database system, intuitive user 
interfaces, robust communication tools, and stringent security measures, aligning with the 
project's objectives. 

## Features

- **Architecture Overview:** The Animal Health Tracker system will adopt a multi-layered architecture, comprising the Presentation Layer, Application Layer, Business Logic Layer, and Data Access Layer. The Presentation Layer will encapsulate the user interface, featuring intuitive and interactive screens for data input, retrieval, and visualization. The Application Layer will manage application flow, while the Business Logic Layer will house the core functionalities, including health record management and monitoring systems. The Data Access Layer will interface with the database, ensuring efficient data retrieval and storage. 
- **Centralized Database System:** A robust and scalable database management system (DBMS) will serve as the cornerstone of the Animal Health Tracker. MySQL will be considered for their reliability and efficiency in storing and retrieving health records. The database schema will be designed to accommodate various species' health data, including medical history, treatments, vaccinations, and diagnostic reports. Indexing and normalization techniques will optimize data retrieval and ensure data integrity. 
- **User Interface and Experience:** The user interface (UI) will prioritize ease of use and accessibility, offering a seamless experience for stakeholders. JavaFX will be employed 
for its ability to create rich, responsive desktop applications. The UI will feature intuitive navigation, interactive dashboards, and forms for data entry. Visualizations, such as charts or graphs, will aid in presenting health trends and analytics. 
- **Health Monitoring System:** A comprehensive health monitoring module will employ real-time alerts and notifications for upcoming medical appointments, vaccination schedules, and critical health events. This system will employ automated reminders and alerts to ensure timely intervention and proper care for the animals under observation.
